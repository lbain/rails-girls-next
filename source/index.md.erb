</h1>

<p>We are very excited to have you at Rails Girls Next. Hopefully you'll come away with a better understanding of Ruby and how the internet works!</p>

<a name="registration-and-coffee-930---945" class="anchor" href="#registration-and-coffee-930---945"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Registration and coffee (9:30 - 9:45)</h3>

<p>During the morning we'll have some coffee, thanks to Ruby Conf AU, so that we're all set for a great day of Rails Girls!</p>

<h3>
<a name="welcome-945---1000" class="anchor" href="#welcome-945---1000"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome (9:45 - 10:00)</h3>

<p>Outline of the day - since you have Ruby installed already, we can jump right into it.</p>

<p>We've broken the day down into 3 exercises so you can practice a few different things. There's no particular order, the list below is just a possible outline.</p>

<h3>
<a name="coding-with-ruby-1000---1130" class="anchor" href="#coding-with-ruby-1000---1130"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Coding with Ruby (10:00 - 11:30)</h3>

<p>At Rails Girls you got to play with Ruby a bit, but now it's time to really understand some of its features and syntax.</p>

<h3>
<a name="fun-with-sinatra-1145---100" class="anchor" href="#fun-with-sinatra-1145---100"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Fun with Sinatra (11:45 - 1:00)</h3>

<p>To give you a better foundation about how the web works, you'll build a simple website using Sinatra. It will be more hands-on than your original Rails Girls site, so be ready to write some code!</p>

<h3>
<a name="lunch-100---200" class="anchor" href="#lunch-100---200"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Lunch (1:00 - 2:00)</h3>

<p>Delicious food from Ruby Conf AU.</p>

<h3>
<a name="test-driven-development-200---330" class="anchor" href="#test-driven-development-200---330"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Test Driven Development (2:00 - 3:20)</h3>

<p>Learn a new way to code (and avoid errors!) by writing tests as you go.</p>

<h3>Feedback Form (3:20 - 3:30)</h3>

<p>We've got a very quick <a href="/rails-girls-next/feedback">feedback form</a> for you. This is the first time we're running Rails Girls Next, and we'd really apprecate your feedback.</p>

<h3>
<a name="retro-330---400" class="anchor" href="#retro-330---400"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Retro (3:30 - 4:00)</h3>

<p>We'll go over everything we did for the day, and hear about your experiences from the day.</p>

<h2>Thank you</h2>
<p>To our awesome <a href="/rails-girls-next/partners">partners</a>! We couldn't have done it without them!</p>
